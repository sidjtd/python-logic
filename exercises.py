#Logic 

#Conditional statements gives us the ability to check conditions and make decisions based on the condition.

#In this assignment, you'll be asked to create conditional statements using if, elif and else. 

# Please commit and push your code after each completed exercise.

#1. Declare a variable named weather and assign it a string value of 'rain'. Next create a conditional statement that will check the weather and print 'Bring an umbrella' if weather equals 'rain'.

weather = 'rain'
if(weather == 'rain'):
    print('Bring an umbrella')

#2 Declare a variable named score and assign it a number value of 70. Next create a conditional statement that will check the score and print 'You pass!' if the score is 70 and above and print 'Study harder!' if the score is less than 70.

score = 0
if(score >= 70):
    print('You pass!')
else:
    print('Study harder!')

#3. Declare a variable named download_speed and assign it a data value of 50. Next create a conditional statement that will check the download speed and print the following based on the condition:

# <= 50 'Basic Package'
# <=100 'Premium Package'
# >100 'Platinum Package'

download_speed = 50

#8 Function even_cryptography
#Create a function named even_cryptography which takes a parameter num.

#The function will print 'Decryption Success' if the number passed into the function is even and print 'Decryption Fail' if it isn't.

def even_cryptography(num):
    if(num%2 == 0):
        print('Decryption Success')
    else:
        print('Decryption Fail')
even_cryptography(2)

#9 Function bandwidth
#Declare a variable named mbps and assign it a list of 5 number values of your choosing. 

#Next, create a function named bandwidth which takes a parameter usage.
#The function will sum up the list of numbers and print the following messages based on the condition:

#if sum <= 50 'Light User'
#if sum <= 100 'Moderate User'
#if sum <=150 'Multi Media User'
#if sum >150 'Power User'

mbps = [3, 88, 168, 68, 2]

def bandwidth(usage):
    if(sum(usage) <= 50):
        print('Light User') 
    elif(sum(usage) <= 100):
        print('Moderate User')
    elif(sum(usage) <= 150):
        print('Multi Media User')
    else:
        print('Power User')
bandwidth(mbps)

#10 Function ssh_keys
#Create a function named ssh_keys which takes two parameters public and private.

#The function will return false if public and private aren't equal and return true if they are equal.

#Declare a variable named ssh_connection and print your result.

def ssh_keys(public, private):
    if(public != private):
        return False
    else:
        return True

ssh_connection = ssh_keys(1, 1)
print(ssh_connection)

#11 Function largest_num
#Create a function named largest_num which takes three parameters: num_1, num_2 and num_3.

#The function will find the largest number among any three numbers that are passed into the function. Declare a variable named large_num_result and print your results.

def largest_num(num_1, num_2, num_3):
    if(num_1 >= num_2) and (num_1 >= num_3):
        return num_1
    elif(num_2 >= num_1) and (num_2 >= num_3):
        return num_2
    else:
        return num_3

large_num_result = largest_num(1,6,8)
print(large_num_result)

#12 Function pos_neg
#Create a function named pos_neg which takes a parameter num.

#The function will print 'Positive Number' if the number passed in is positive, print 'Zero' if the number is 0 and print 'Negative Number' for a negative number.

def pos_neg(num):
    if(num > 0):
        print('Positive Number')
    elif(num == 0):
        print('Zero')
    else:
        print('Negative Number')
pos_neg(-1)

#13 Function leap_year

#A leap year occurs every four years. Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

#Create a function named leap_year which takes a parameter year.
#The function will print 'The year x is a leap year.' where x is the year value that is passed into the function and print 'The year x is not a leap year.' if it isn't a leap year.

def leap_year(year):
    if(year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 == 0) and (year % 400 == 0):
        print('The year ' + str(year) + ' is a leap year.')
    else:
        print('The year ' + str(year) + ' is not a leap year.')
